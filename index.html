        <p>I am a rising senior at the University of Chicago studying computer science.</p>

    <div class="floatbox">
        <p>This summer, I am working at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Intern. Last summer, I worked as
            a Quantitative Developer Intern at an electricity trading company, SESCO
            Enterprises.</p>

        <p>My interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Specifically, I am
            interested in developing systems to address the shortcomings of human capabilities. Some of these include
            fast complex data analysis, recognizing and translating speech, or driving a car without crashing. I hope to
            contribute to some of these fields in the future to try and make the world a safer and more enjoyable place.

        <p>I enjoy spending my
            free time weightlifting, golfing, and playing the piano. I am also an All-American diver on my university's
            Varsity Swimming and Diving team.</p>
